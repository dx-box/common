# @dx-box/common

`@dx-box/common` is a utility package that improves developer experience (DX) by providing common configurations for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and automated Git hooks for formatting and linting.

---

## TODO

1. Automatic fixes with Git hooks for Prettier and ESLint
2. Absolute path (alias) configuration for TS, ESLint, and Prettier
3. Import statement sorting
4. Component props sorting
5. Component argument props sorting
6. Component member sorting (state, hooks, handlers, etc.)
7. Support for merging with existing user configurations
8. Framework-specific options (React, Vue, etc.) - planned

---

## Usage

- Install via `npm install @dx-box/common --save-dev`
- Run `dx-common init` to set up base configs and Git hooks automatically
- Supports auto-generation and merging of `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`, and `tsconfig.json`
